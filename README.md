##  Project Overview

Welcome to the **Churn Prediction Project**! ðŸš€ This is a full-stack **machine learning pipeline** aimed at predicting customer churn. Here's what makes it shine:

-  **Data Exploration & Visualization**: Dive deep into customer behavior through EDA.
-  **Modeling**: Train and compare multiple algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and more.
-  **Deployment**: Experience live predictions via an elegant **Streamlit app**.
-  **Interpretability**: Gain insights into why customers churn and how to retain them.

##  Business Context & Insights

Churn can significantly impact revenue. According to industry sources, acquiring a new customer costs up to **five times more** than retaining an existing one :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. To tackle churn effectively:

1. **Define churn** clearly (e.g., subscription cancellation or inactivity).
2. **Gather diverse data**: demographics, usage patterns, feedback.
3. **Preprocess wisely**: manage missing values, encode features, handle imbalances.
4. **Model & evaluate**: choose algorithms that balance accuracy and recall.
5. **Deploy & monitor** via tools like Streamlit for real-time predictions.

This project aims to blend **business value and technical rigour** seamlessly.
